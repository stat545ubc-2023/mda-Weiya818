   - Reading and writing data as separate files
   
## Outcomes of this Deliverable
 * Manipulating special data types in R such as factors and/or dates and times
 * Being able to fit a model object to the data, and extract a result
 * Reading and writing data as separate files
    
## How to Engage in the Project
  * Git clone the github repository to the local R studio
  * _"Knit"_ the mini_data_analysis_2.Rmd file
  * It will generate a mini_data_analysis_2.md file
  * Read through the generated md file that contains all the contents of the Mini Data Analysis Project
  * The dataset I analyze is called _vancouver_trees_ dataset
