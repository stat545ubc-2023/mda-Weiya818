# STAT 545A Mini Data Analysis Project M1 _(Weiya Zhu)_

## Project Description
 * Explore 4 datasets and choose one of them to perform data analysis.
 * Perform 4 data analysis exercises using the knowledge of dplyr and ggplot2 and including brief explanations to state the importance of doing so.
 * Think about 4 further research questions for Milestone 2
   
## Outcomes of this Deliverable
 * Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown
 * Become familiar with manipulating and summarizing the data in tibbles using dplyr packages and generate useful graphs for data analysis using ggplot2
    
## How to engage in the Project
  * Git clone the github repository to the local R studio
  * "Knit" the mini_data_analysis_1.Rmd file
  * It will generate a mini_data_analysis_1.md file
  * Read through the generated md file that contains all the contents of the Mini Data Analysis Project (M1)
  * The dataset I analyze is called _vancouver_trees_ dataset.
