# STAT 545A Mini Data Analysis Project M1 _(Weiya Zhu)_

## Project Description
 * Milestone 1
   - Explore 4 datasets and choose one of them to perform data analysis
   - Perform 4 data analysis exercises using the knowledge of dplyr and ggplot2 and including brief explanations to state the importance of doing so
   - Think about 4 further research questions for Milestone 2
 * Milestone 2
   - Make summary tables and graphs for each research questions
   - Manipulate special data types in R such as factors and/or dates and times
   - Fit a model object to the data, and extract results
   - Reading and writing data as separate files
   
## Outcomes of this Deliverable
 * Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown
 * Become familiar with manipulating and summarizing the data in tibbles using dplyr packages and generate useful graphs for data analysis using ggplot2
 * Manipulating special data types in R such as factors and/or dates and times
 * Being able to fit a model object to the data, and extract a result
 * Reading and writing data as separate files
    
## How to Engage in the Project
  * Git clone the github repository to the local R studio
  * _"Knit"_ the mini_data_analysis_1.Rmd or mini_data_analysis_2.Rmd file
  * It will generate a mini_data_analysis_1.md or mini_data_analysis_2.md file accordingly
  * Read through the generated md file that contains all the contents of the Mini Data Analysis Project
  * The dataset I analyze is called _vancouver_trees_ dataset
  
## Files in the Repository
