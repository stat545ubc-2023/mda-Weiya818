# README file for M1 

## Project Description
 * Milestone 1
   - Explore 4 datasets and choose one of them to perform data analysis
   - Perform 4 data analysis exercises using the knowledge of dplyr and ggplot2 and including brief explanations to state the importance of doing so
   - Think about 4 further research questions for Milestone 2
 
## Outcomes of this Deliverable
 * Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown
 * Become familiar with manipulating and summarizing the data in tibbles using dplyr packages and generate useful graphs for data analysis using ggplot2
 
## How to Engage in the Project
  * Git clone the github repository to the local R studio
  * _"Knit"_ the mini_data_analysis_1.Rmd file
  * It will generate a mini_data_analysis_1.md file
  * Read through the generated md file that contains all the contents of the Mini Data Analysis Project
  * The dataset I analyze is called _vancouver_trees_ dataset
